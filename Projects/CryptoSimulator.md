# Crypto Simulator ðŸŽ«

## Description

Technology is always changing and evolving, and with that come new and exciting ways to implement it. An interesting trend is the blockchain and cryptocurrency market. For this reason, we want to have a website that shows the values of popular cryptocurrencies and have a simulator that would let a user "BUY" cryptocurrency on a certain day and then see how their value goes up or down. This site should create a simulated crypto portfolio for people that are maybe not sure or can't invest in crypto yet but want to see what investment would get them.
