# Tech Blog âš¾

## Description

You can never have enough tech blogs on the internet. This is because every person has his approach to different problems, and this creates a wide network of different solutions that help future developers to not re-invent the wheel and push forward faster and easier. We want to have a technical blog built with a simple username/password verification where a single user can write technical blogs. The blog format should contain a cover picture, a title, and text. The blog should list the newest blogs first and the oldest, last. This view can change with different filters by month or by tags. People can also leave a star and anonymous comments on every blog post. A key part of this blog is the notifications. You can leave your e-mail and get a notification when a new blog post is published.
